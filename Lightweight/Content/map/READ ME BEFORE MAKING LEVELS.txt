Hello!

Game boards are 58*32. This is to reflect the fact that the border is drawn automatically, to avoid having enemies and traps spawn on the walls.

The following is the format for making levels:

X - Normal tile
O - Trap Tile
E - Normal Spawn with Enemy placement on top

Please make sure to check you have the right format! Otherwise, there will be issues when loading.
Additionally, in loaded mode, the waves will continue on the same board with randomized enemy spawns.
