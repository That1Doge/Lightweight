# Lightweight

Lightweight is the title of my semester project for the course "Game Development and Algorithmic Problem Solving II" at the Rochester Institute of Technology. The project was completed in the spring of 2023 by a student team of four. The game is a top-down shooter with a focus on balancing item pickups. The player's speed changes based on the amount of scrap they are carrying -- too much will slow you down, but too little will send you flying into traps and enemies. The game was developed using C# and the MonoGame framework.
